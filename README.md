# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

This project focuses on performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the structure, patterns, and insights within a dataset. The goal was to highlight trends, detect anomalies, and summarize findings for better decision-making.

## Key Tasks

* **Trend & Distribution Analysis**: Conducted exploratory analysis to uncover trends, distributions, and patterns in the dataset.
* **Outlier Detection**: Detected outliers and anomalies, providing insights into data quality and potential business implications.
* **Insights Generation**: Summarized key findings into actionable insights to support decision-making and guide future modeling efforts.

## Tech Stack

* SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL / SQL Server)

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/a-aggarwal7/Expo_data_analysis.git
   cd Expo_data_analysis
   ```
2. Import the dataset into your SQL database.
3. Run the provided SQL scripts or queries to reproduce the analysis.

## Results

The EDA revealed key patterns, anomalies, and distributions, providing a solid foundation for further statistical modeling and machine learning applications.
